# Winton Stock Market Challenge
As a part of an internship at Bennett University in 2019, a team of three interns under the guidance of a professor worked on the Winton Stock Market Challenge on Kaggle. 
This is the record kept by one of the interns of the progress made over the duration of the internship. It is not an independent project, rather a project that was worked on by the entire team as a part of the internship.
